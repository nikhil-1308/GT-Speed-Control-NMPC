# GT-Speed-Control-NMPC
Gas Turbine response to grid frequency change using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. The frequency change was simulated by changing the net torque on the GT shaft.

# Description
In this illustrative example, we employ a nonlinear model predictive control technique to manipulate the combustion equivalence ratio (PHI). The widely adopted approach in gas turbine (GT) controls involves selecting minimum value for Fuel Stroke Reference and Inlet Guide Vane. The manipulated variable (PHI) is then transformed into fuel flow and air flow references, which are subsequently utilized by a PI controller. For the purpose of this example, we focus solely on the Fuel Stroke Reference. The underlying nonlinear physics-based model represents a fundamental analytical depiction of a gas turbine, based on the Brayton cycle principle. Itâ€™s important to note that the constants and scaling factors have been deliberately chosen in a minimalistic manner, and this model does not fully represent a real-world GT. Instead, it serves to demonstrate how nonlinear model predictive control can rapidly respond to changes in GT speed. Nonlinear MPC design in this example is designed using the "fmincon" Matlab's in bult function.
